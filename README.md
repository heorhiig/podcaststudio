# Podcast Studion
**In this app oyu can listen and save your favorite podcasts**
## Creation of idea 
Nowadays, people have really embraced the ability to listen to something while doing something, to combine business with pleasure.
Podcasts are a wonderful ray of hope that helps us brighten up our daily routines at work or other activities with something useful and interesting. 
That's why I wanted to create this app, so more people could try it and perhaps enrich their lives with something new and interesting.

## What can my app provide?
My app doesn't have a lot of unnecessary features. It's simple: add, save, listen, update, or delete.
Most functions are located on the main menu:

         > |   2) Update a podcast          |
         > |   3) Delete a podcast          |
         > |   4) List podcasts             |
         > |   5) Create a playlist         |
         > |   6) Playlists                 |
         > ----------------------------------
         > |   20) Save podcast & playlists |
         > |   21) Load podcast & playlists |
         > ----------------------------------
         > |   0) Exit                      |
         > ----------------------------------

The main functionality of my app is adding a podcast by entering its title, description, author, date, path to the MP3 audio file, and a favorite option. 
The core idea behind this app is already there, but that's not all the functionality. Of course, you can delete or update a podcast at any time. 
But you also have the ability to group podcasts into playlists.
After creating a playlist where you enter the title, description, favorite option or not, and the ability to select podcasts from the list that appears, which contains podcasts that you previously added.
**You will be able to open the playlist menu**

                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                1) List All playlists
                2) List Favorite playlists
                3) Open Playlist 
                4) Update Playlist
                5) Delete playlist
                0) Back

Where you can choose the features provided to you.
The main feature of my application is listening to audio files in the console, which may pleasantly surprise you.
Due to the limitations in the capabilities of using all technologies (AI) today, my knowledge in managing audio files is limited and cannot
yet have an ideal appearance, but this will definitely be corrected in future updates

## Creating an the app
The main example in creating this application is the Note App, which I made earlier, but some functionality was taken from forums and open source projects. 
It was very helpful in learning and creating the ability to play sound and a progress counter.

Much of the project was written based on experience from previous works and is included in this appendix.

The main problem in creating the app was ability to listen the audio files but for help comin forums and video on youtube

most of code to listen aoudio was taken from forums but the not small part I did for myself and this was very intresting and hard

## Problems and malfunctions 
1. Main problem what my app have for now it is big list of warnings befor you start listen podcas, but this does not interfere with the operation of the application
- This problem will be fixed in a new update
2. A small malfunctions that doesn't interfere with work but is unpleasant to the eye is the kotlin.Unit inscription.
- The reason for its appearance is not yet clear
